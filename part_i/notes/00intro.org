Why Study Algorithms?

* Study of algorithms dates back to Euclid
* Formalized by Church and Turing in the 1930s

The main reason to study algorithms is to solve problems that could not otherwise be addressed. For example, the network connectivity problem.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For me, great algorithms are the poetry of computation. Just like verse, they can be terse, allusive, dense, and even mysterious.
â€” Francis Sullivan

Why else should we study algorithms?

They have become a common language for understanding nature. Computational models are replacing math models in scientific inquiry.



Prerequisites:

- Programming: loops, arrays, functions, objects, recursion.
- Java: we use as expository language.
- Sections 1.1 and 1.2 of [Algorithms, 4th ed.](https://github.com/ahrjarrett/library/blob/master/algorithms/Algorithhms%204th%20Edition%20by%20Robert%20Sedgewick%2C%20Kevin%20Wayne.pdf)
