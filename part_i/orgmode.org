* Source Code:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript

  /* how does this format in the browser?
   ,* is this rendered like ``` blocks in github flavored markdown?
   ,*/

  // single line comment

  const myConstant = 'this is my constant'

  // not tail-recursive tho
  function factorial(n) {
    if(n === 1) return n
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  }

  let a = Array.prototype
  
  console.log(a) // [constructor: ƒ, concat: ƒ, pop: ƒ, push: ƒ, shift: ƒ, …]
  
  factorial(5)
#+END_SRC
